Now, we’re taking it a step further by teaming up with Pollen, who is one of the only company in the world that actually ships open-source humanoid robots!\\n\\nThe first robot we’re offering is Reachy 2 — your friendly little lab partner for the AI era that is already in use in labs like Cornell or Carnegie Mellon. It’s a state-of-the-art humanoid robot that is open-source & VR-compatible, built for research, education, and embodied AI experiments. You can already order one for $70,000!\\n\\nWe believe robotics could be the next interface for AI — and it should be open, affordable, and hackable. Our vision: a future where everyone from the community can build and control their own robot companions instead of relying on closed, expensive black boxes.\\n\\nLet’s go open robotics 💪🤖\\n2,047\\n65 Comments\\nLike\\nComment\\nShare\\nHugging Face\\nreposted this\\nAIM Research\\n19,358 followers\\n1d\\nReport this post\\nHugging Face\\n, a leader in open-source AI, has acquired French startup\\nPollen Robotics\\nto push the boundaries of accessible and open robotics.

As part of the deal, co-founders\\nMatthieu Lapeyre\\nand\\nPierre Rouanet\\n, along with around 20 team members, will join Hugging Face. This marks the company’s first official step into the hardware side of robotics.\\n\\nReachy 2, currently used by researchers at Cornell and Carnegie Mellon University, is designed for academic, research, and embodied AI testing. Hugging Face, known for championing open-source AI, had previously collaborated with Pollen, and now plans to make the technology more affordable and accessible. “Robotics is going to be the next frontier that AI will unlock,” said\\nThomas Wolf\\n, co-founder and chief scientist at Hugging Face.\\nWolf emphasized the importance of safety and transparency in robotics: “Open-source software has proven over time to be more secure.” He highlighted recent security concerns in other robotics platforms, reinforcing why open-source AI models should guide physical machines. There’s also a long-term vision to open-source Reachy’s hardware, enabling people to 3D print parts and modify the robot freely.\\n\\nThis move follows Hugging Face’s growing involvement in robotics, including the launch of LeRobot, a robotics code library, and a partnership with\\nNVIDIA\\nin 2025 to host its GR00T N1 model for humanoid robots. With cost-effective solutions like the $100 SO-100 robotic arm, Hugging Face aims to make robotics both fun and functional, bringing AI out of the cloud and into the real world.\\n1,571\\n28 Comments\\nLike\\nComment\\nShare\\nHugging Face\\n936,040 followers\\n2d\\nReport this post\\nSuper happy to announce that we are acquiring\\nPollen Robotics\\nto bring open-source robots to the world! 🤖\\n\\nSince\\nRemi Cadene\\njoined us from Tesla, we’ve become the most widely used software platform for open robotics thanks to LeRobot and the Hugging Face Hub. Now, we’re taking it a step further by teaming up with Pollen, who is one of the only company in the world that actually ships open-source humanoid robots!\\n\\nThe first robot we’re offering is Reachy 2 — your friendly little lab partner for the AI era that is already in use in labs like Cornell or Carnegie Mellon. It’s a state-of-the-art humanoid robot that is open-source & VR-compatible, built for research, education, and embodied AI experiments. You can already order one for $70,000!\\n\\nWe believe robotics could be the next interface for AI — and it should be open, affordable, and hackable.
